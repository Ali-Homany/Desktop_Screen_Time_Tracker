This application helps you track your screen & browser time usage.
It consists of 4 components:
	- Tracker: runs with startup automatically, in the background, all the time, saving data about what apps are used and how much
	- Chrome Extension: sends requests to the local app about what website is being used in chrome.
	- Browser Tracker: also runs in background on startup, recieving requests from the chrome extension and saving what websites are used
	- Webapp: summarizes the recorded data and displays it in cool simple graphs (for screen & for browser) and provides some customization in settings page.
