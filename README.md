# Desktop_Screen_Time_Tracker
Simple python screen time tracker for windows desktop.

## Components:
### \# Utils:
Provides utilities functionalities for other parts of the application.

**1. DB:** Creates database schema using SQLAlchemy, and provides necessary methods to interact with the database

**2. Summarizer:** Reads the records file & does necessary transformation.

**3. Charts:** Creates plotly figures as json depending on user preferences.

**4. Icon Extractor:** Uses PIL library to extract icons from the active window, if it is a new app.

**5. Logger:** logs errors to local file

### \# Recorder
Uses win32gui library to record the active window every second

### \# Extension
Chrome extension which helps the application to save current active tab in chrome, by sending requests to the browser_recorder.

### \# Browser Recorder
Builds a very basic flask app to recieve requests from the chrome extension and record the active chrome tab every second.

### \# App:
Builds a simple Flask webapp that displays the screen time daily/monthly/yearly, and usage by apps for a selected day.

It consists of 4 blueprints:
- home.py: provides basic routes for the webapp
- browser.py: provides routes for the webapp for browser time tracking
- settings.py: provides routes for changing user preferences
- report.py: provides routes for the weekly/monthly report

## Usage
For the ready-to-use application, download the executable installer from the latest release, [here](https://github.com/Ali-Homany/Desktop_Screen_Time_Tracker/releases/tag/v0.3.0). Run it and follow the instructions within the installer.

In order to re-create the Installer executable from the code yourself, kindly follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repo
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Ali-Homany/Desktop_Screen_Time_Tracker.git
    ```
2. Create conda environment:

    [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on your machine if you don't have it yet, open its `anaconda prompt` then run
    ```
    conda create --name screen_time_env python
    ```
3. Install dependencies:

    Activate the new environment
    ```
    conda activate screen_time_env
    ```
    Then install the requirements using pip
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run [create_application.bat](./deploy/create_application.bat) (make sure to run in the project root directory):

    This will create 3 executables and wrap them into an Installer executable. Done!

However, if you're more curious or you don't want to run an installer (step 4), you might continue the steps below instead:

4. Create shortcuts for the recorder.exe, browser_recorder.exe and main.exe

5. Run Recorder on Startup:

    Move the 2 recorders shortcuts to the `C:\Users\Admiin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\`
    
    Now the recorders will run on startup and log the screen time to the screentime.db file.

6. Run the main.exe to view your screen time dashboard!
