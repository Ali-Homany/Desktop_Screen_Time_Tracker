# Desktop_Screen_Time_Tracker
Simple python screen time tracker for windows desktop.

## Components:
### 1. DB
Creates database schema using SQLAlchemy, and provides necessary methods to interact with the database:
- create_db
- get_all_records
- add_record
- is_transformation_needed
- transform_new_data

### 2. Recorder
Uses win32gui library to record the active window every second

Includes following methods:
- get_active_window_info
- record_active_window
- log

### 3. Summarizer
Reads the records file & does necessary transformation.

Includes following methods:
- seconds_to_time
- get_usage_by_apps
- get_unique_days
- get_daily_usage

### 4. App
Builds a simple Dash webapp that displays the screen time (for now) daily/monthly/yearly.
Screenshots of the dashboard:

  <img src="./dashboard2.png" alt="Daily Usage Dashboard" width="400"/>
</p>

## To Do:
- ~~Set default value of App Usage Graph to today~~
- ~~Make tracking more efficient:~~
    - ~~Use db (sqlalchemy) instead of csv~~
    - ~~Save data in normalized form (saves alot of space instead of repeating apps names for e.g)~~
    - ~~Insert records as batches (keep 30s in-memory) to reduce I/O~~
    - ~~Summarize old days into hourly app usage data only (each 86,400 rows -> number of apps * 24)~~
- Improve Dashboard Design
- Add export option to export data to csv or excel
- Add app icons to dashboard

These are just some ideas to be done soon, surely on the long-run many features could be added. Don't hesitate to share any suggestions!

## Usage
For the ready-to-use application, download the executable setup file from the latest release, [here](https://github.com/homanydata/Desktop_Screen_Time_Tracker/releases/tag/v0.1.0). Run it and follow the instructions within the installer.

To try the code yourself, you can do the following:

1. Clone the repo
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Desktop_Screen_Time_Tracker.git
    ```
2. Install the requirements
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Create executables

    Run the following commands in the command line (in the project directory)
    ```
    pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --hidden-import=xml.parsers.expat recorder.py
    ```
    ```
    pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import=xml.parsers.expat --add-data "assets;assets" app.py
    ```
    You will find the exectuables in the dist folder. Make sure to move the recorder.exe and app.exe to the root directory of the repository.

4. Create a shortcut for the recorder.exe

5. Run Recorder on Startup:

    Move the shortcut to the `C:\Users\Admiin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\`.
    
    Now the recorder will run on startup and log the screen time to the active_apps_log.csv file.

6. Run the app.exe to view the screen time.
